# Todo App with API

## 🎮 About the Project
This is the final part of the **Todo App** project. In this part, functionality for **toggling the status** of todos (marking them as completed or active) and **renaming** them is implemented, using an external API. It builds upon the first two parts where todos are loaded, added, and deleted. 

The full project consists of three parts:
1. [Load Todos](https://github.com/AndriiZakharenko/todo-app-loading-todos) - Fetches and displays todos from the API.
2. [Add and Delete](https://github.com/AndriiZakharenko/todo-app-add-and-delete) - Implements the functionality to add and delete todos.
3. **Toggle and Rename** - Implements the functionality to toggle the status of todos and rename them.

In this third part, you can toggle the status of todos (marking them completed or active) and also rename them, all through the interaction with an external API.
